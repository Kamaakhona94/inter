#### Steps to Update `README.md`
1. Open `https://github.com/Kamaakhona94/inter/edit/main/README.md`.
2. Replace the existing content with the above Markdown.
3. Commit with a message (e.g., "Updated Inter Wiki with CodeQL integration").

### 3. Test the Workflow
- **Push a Change**:
  - Make a small change to `gold_bot.py` (e.g., add a comment) and push to `main`:
    ```bash
    git add gold_bot.py
    git commit -m "Test CodeQL workflow"
    git push origin main
    ```
- **Check Actions**:
  - Go to the "Actions" tab on `https://github.com/Kamaakhona94/inter`.
  - Look for the "CodeQL Analysis" workflow run.
  - Verify it completes successfully and check the "Security" tab for results.

- **Expected Outcome**:
  - CodeQL will analyze `gold_bot.py` for issues like insecure data handling or potential bugs.
  - If issues are found, they’ll be listed as alerts under "Security" > "Code scanning."

### 4. Additional Notes
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `gold_bot.py`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, and `LICENSE` are in the repository, as set up previously.
- **Security**: CodeQL will help identify vulnerabilities (e.g., unsafe use of `eval` or hardcoded credentials). If alerts appear, address them by refactoring (e.g., using `.env` for credentials, as already implemented).
- **Wiki Expansion**: If you want a separate GitHub Wiki (instead of `README.md`), go to the "Wiki" tab on your repository and create pages there. I can help with that if needed!

### Clarification
This provides "one full thing" (the CodeQL workflow) and updates the wiki (`README.md`) to document it. If you meant something else (e.g., a different script or a separate wiki page), please let me know, and I’ll adjust! For now, add the `codeql.yml` file and update `README.md` as described, then test the workflow. Let me know how it goes!
