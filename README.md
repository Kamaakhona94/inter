![Inter API Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150.png?text=Inter+API) <!-- Placeholder for logo -->

The `inter` project is a robust API designed to streamline order processing for small to medium-sized e-commerce businesses (SMEs). Evolving from a simple file-copying utility, `inter` now provides a secure, user-friendly solution for managing orders, tracking analytics, and automating workflows.

## Project Overview

The `inter` API empowers SMEs to manage e-commerce orders efficiently. Key features include:
- Order processing (e.g., creating orders like ID "12345" for a "Laptop" and "Mouse" totaling $1250.00).
- Real-time analytics dashboard for order trends and customer behavior.
- Webhook support for automating workflows (e.g., inventory sync).
- Secure authentication using OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Single Sign-On (SSO).

Built with SMEs in mind, `inter` balances user-friendliness with robust security to protect against common cyber threats like credential stuffing and API abuse.

## Features

- **Order Processing**: Create, update, and track orders with endpoints like `POST /orders`.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Monitor order summaries and customer behavior (e.g., abandonment rates) via a dashboard at `https://inter.notegpt.com/dashboard`.
- **Webhook Automation**: Subscribe to events (e.g., `order.created`, `inventory.updated`) to automate workflows.
- **Secure Authentication**: Use OAuth 2.0 with OIDC for SSO, supporting IdPs like Google and Microsoft.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Transparent consent screens and comprehensive documentation ensure ease of use.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the `inter` API, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.8+**: For running the API server.
- **Redis**: For caching and rate limiting (installation: `sudo apt install redis-server` on Ubuntu).
- **MongoDB**: For storing orders and logs (installation: follow [MongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)).
- **VSCode**: Recommended for development (optional).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/inter.git
